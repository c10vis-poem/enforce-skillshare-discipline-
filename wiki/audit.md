# Codebase Consistency Audit

Use when asked to audit the codebase, flags, documentation, tests, targets, handler splits, oplog coverage, or Web API consistency. This topic is read-only: report findings without modifying files.

## Evidence Rules

- Give every finding a file path, line number, and direct evidence.
- Search before deciding so naming differences do not become false positives.
- Base conclusions on current code and configuration rather than stale documentation or memory.
- When the user names a dimension, inspect only that scope. Run every dimension only for a full audit.

## Dimensions

### CLI Flags

Compare flag, usage, and argument definitions in `cmd/skillshare/*.go` with `website/docs/reference/commands/*.md`:

- `UNDOCUMENTED`: present in code but absent from documentation.
- `STALE`: documented but absent from code, or behavior has changed.
- `OK`: name, mode, default, and semantics agree.

### Specifications and Tests

- For completed `specs/`, verify the implementation and testable acceptance criteria.
- For each command handler, inspect unit and integration coverage. A matching filename alone does not prove coverage.
- Use `IMPLEMENTED/MISMATCH/PENDING` and `COVERED/PARTIAL/MISSING` classifications.

### Targets and Schemas

Inspect `internal/config/targets.yaml` for names, aliases, global/project paths, and collisions, then compare configuration validation, schemas, and target tests. Never assume every target supports the same resource kinds.

### Handler Split

Find large `cmd/skillshare/*.go` files and verify that dispatch files contain only flags and mode routing while core logic, rendering, prompts, TUIs, batching, and resolution follow `cli-development` conventions. Roughly 300 lines is a review trigger, not an automatic failure.

### Oplog

Mutating commands should write the operations log; read-only commands should not write merely for consistency. Inspect success and error paths, duration, arguments, and the audit-log boundary. Determine which commands mutate state from current behavior rather than a fixed historical list.

### Web API

Compare routes in `internal/server/server.go`, `handler_*.go` files, handler tests, and `ui/src/api/client.ts`. CLI-only or API-only behavior may be intentional; inspect the product surface before reporting an issue.

`GET /api/resources` returns `resources` and `sourceLinkWarnings` (one string per first-level source link skipped during discovery). Healthy resources remain in the inventory when a link is unavailable. It also returns `linked_repos: [{name, target}]` so the Updates tab knows which followed Git checkouts are user-owned before running a check.

`GET /api/check` and the `done` event of `GET /api/check/stream` return the same `linked_repos` field separately from `tracked_repos`. Linked checkouts are excluded from Git checks and work-unit totals. Dashboard update endpoints return a `skipped` result for them before running Git, including force retries and skills within those checkouts.

Source-link endpoints (skills only, in the dashboard's current global/project mode):

| Endpoint | Request | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/source-links` | `{path, name?, enable?}` | `{path, target, kind, warning}`; `kind` is `symlink` or `junction` |
| `DELETE /api/source-links/{name}` | First-level link name | `{success, name}`; moves only the link to trash |

Both call `internal/sourcelink`, share the uninstall routes' middleware, and return guard refusals as HTTP 400 with the core reason in the string `error` field. `enable: true` persists `follow_source_links` in the current config and refreshes the follow snapshot. The skills page's **Link folder** dialog offers that setting only while it is off. `GET /api/resources` adds optional `linkName` and `linkTarget` fields to skills beneath a followed first-level source link; the target is resolved by the same discovery policy, and skipped links are not identified as followed. It also returns `sourceLinks: [{name, target, available, warning?}]` independently of skill discovery, including empty and dangling first-level links. `available` means the current follow policy accepts the link; skipped links have `available: false` and a warning explaining why. Linked groups use a link icon and muted target path in list/cards headers; the icon-only **Unlink** button changes from a link icon to an unlink icon on hover or focus. Tree rows use a link icon and keep the target and secondary **Unlink** action in the detail pane. Empty linked groups remain visible in list, cards, and tree views with the target, zero-skill count or warning, and an icon-only **Unlink** button; their confirmation dialog accepts an empty skill list. Linked groups have no Update repo action or group context menu; the Updates tab covers followed checkouts. Unlink confirms target preservation, affected skills on the next sync, and Trash-page recovery before sending a request; linked skill uninstall confirms that the selected skills move out of the linked folder into trash.

`DELETE /api/resources/{name}` and `POST /api/uninstall/batch` (`{names: [flatName], kind?: "skill", force?: bool}`) resolve individual skills beneath followed first-level links with the same follow policy as discovery, before applying tracked-repo restrictions. They move only the selected skill through `sourcefs.CheckSkillMoveOut`, preserving its logical path (for example, `_dev-skills/foo`) in trash for policy-aware restore. A skill at the link target's root is refused with `is the linked folder itself; use unlink to remove the link` (single HTTP 400, batch per-item error), as in CLI uninstall; explicit unlink uses `CheckMoveOut` and moves only the link. The link and sibling skills stay in place. Real tracked-repo members remain protected, and links skipped by the policy are not treated as followed. Single uninstall returns `{success, name, movedToTrash}`; batch returns per-name `results` and a `summary` with `succeeded` and `failed` counts. These two routes, `DELETE /api/repos/{name}` and CLI `uninstall` all run `internal/uninstall`, so each prunes the removed item's install metadata and target overrides; only the batch route also reconciles the skills config. `DELETE /api/repos/{name}` refuses a tracked repo with uncommitted changes or unreadable git status with HTTP 409 unless `?force=true` is passed (the dashboard does not pass it yet), and refuses a linked folder that is itself a skill with 409.

`POST /api/trash/{name}/restore` restores skills using the current global/project follow policy. A logical name such as `_dev-skills/foo` restores into the link target when the policy follows that link; with `follow_source_links` off, it returns HTTP 500 with the existing `is a link; edit its target directly` refusal and preserves the trash entry. Link names do not determine permission to follow. Agent restore is unchanged.

## Report

Use a concise table for each dimension:

| Item | Status | Evidence | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|

End with confirmed issues, intentional differences, uncertainty, and recommended priority. Do not fix findings during an audit. If the user later requests fixes, load the appropriate implementation topic.
